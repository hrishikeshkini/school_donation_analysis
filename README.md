## Problem Statement
Which 10 states have the most number of schools that opened projects to gather donations ? Plot the data using bar plot.

What are the top 10 states in which schools gathered most amount of AVERAGE donations for their projects ?

Analyse the Maximum , minimum , mean ,meadian and 25 and 75% percentiles of Donations?

In which percent the data has points greater or smaller than the value shown in the x axis.

In which states there are more donations done by donors.

Now, it is time for a more advanced question ? Is there a relationship between the number of projects offered and number of donations made by the donors. Which states performing better in this case ? How many of them responding project requests below average and which states are performing best in terms of donations per project ? 

fit a linear model which will basically indicate the relationship between projects and donations.

How many different project types exists ? What is the total donation amount for each of them ?

How many project subject category trees exists ? Which ones attracted the most donations ?

What is the mean time that takes a project to be fully funded after posted and how it varies between states ?

Which states are the best and which are the worst performing in terms of this criteria ( mean project fully funded time) ??

## Approach
Data Exploration : I started exploring dataset using pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn.

Data visualization : Ploted graphs to get insights about dependend and independed variables.

Feature Engineering : Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.
